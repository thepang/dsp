[Think Stats Chapter 2 Exercise 4](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2003.html#toc24) (Cohen's d)

Using the function provided by the exercise, the following effect sizes were calculated. The first is for pregnancy length and the second for total weight.
```
thinkstats2.CohenEffectSize(firsts.prglngth, others.prglngt)
0.028879044654449883

thinkstats2.CohenEffectSize(firsts.totalwgt_lb, others.totalwgt_lb)
-0.088672927072602
```

It appears that neither is impacted much by birth order, though pregnancy length is a bit more impacted.
